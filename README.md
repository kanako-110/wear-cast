# About "WeatCast"
This is an application that you can see today's Vancouver weather forecast and find the outfits that match the weather!
You can post your outfits yourself, or get inspiration from others' outfits of the day.



# Language and Libraries
- Vue3
- TypeScript
- Vuetify
- Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage)
- axios
- [Weatherbit](https://www.weatherbit.io/)

Vue3 allows us to efficiently build scalable and maintainable applications, leveraging its Composition API.

Also, I chose Firestore for its high query flexibility, and because real-time updates, which aren't necessary for this application, are not a concern.
